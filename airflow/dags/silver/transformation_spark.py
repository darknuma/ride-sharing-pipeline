"""
Orchestrate the full ETL pipeline: from Kafka ingestion through Spark processing, transformations, and Delta Lake storage. You could have a DAG that:
Ingests data from Kafka
Processes and transforms data with Spark
Writes data to Delta Lake
This will allow  to easily track and manage each stage of the ETL process, retry failed tasks, and visualize data flow dependencies.
